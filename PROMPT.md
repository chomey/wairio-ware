@PRD.md @activity.md

We are rebuilding the project from scratch in this repo.

First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

Open PRD.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

Work on exactly ONE task: implement the change.

Verify that it works with Godot.

Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing what you changed and the screenshot filename.

Update the log with a message saying you're starting, and every minute do a short status update as well.

Update that task's passes in PRD.md from false to true.

Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message.

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.

When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
